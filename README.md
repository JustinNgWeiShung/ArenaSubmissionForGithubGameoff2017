# ArenaSubmissionForGithubGameoff2017

Made with Godot Engine 2.1.4
https://godotengine.org/download

You can paste the executable into the root of this folder and run the game
If you want to see the actual insides, then run godot outside of this root folder and then import the engine.cfg of this project into godot

Distribution into exe was made using the export templates

Playtesting to be done when there is time.

This project is my first gamejam project that I completed and also my first time using Godot engine.
